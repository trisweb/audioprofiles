Audio Profiles
==============
"Share your Sweet Sounding Stuff"
--------------------------------

AudioProfiles is a new site where audiophiles, audio enthusiasts, and anyone interested in audio gear can make a profile to show off their stuff.

It should be implemented in three feature phases, rougly listed below.

Implementation and Feature Plan
===============================

1. **Simple profiles.**
	- Users should be able to create an account, log in, and edit simple profile information, 
	- Text description of gear in freeform list form. Markdown syntax. 
	- Other users (including the public) should be able to view the profile easily at a global URL such as `http://www.audioprofiles.com/username`

2. **More complex profiles.**
	- Users can add gear from a universal database of gear using a slick interface (search-as-you-type and selecting)
	- Listing of gear by category, with statistics (number of owners, etc)
	- Add gear that doesn't yet exist quickly and easily, with only simple information such as name, type, approximate price, and manufacturer.
	- See who has what gear while browsing gear. Perhaps gear could be listed on profiles by category.

3. **More complex gear functionality.**
	- User notes and reviews. Notes can be private or public, reviews are always public.
	- Quick ratings, including a way to easily mass-rate your stuff (especially good if this phase is an upgrade)
	- Purchase links, and purchase prices per user; to come up with an "average price."
	- "Status" - tags. "listened to", "own", "want", "to buy", etc. Ala Goodreads? Could also be fixed options, custom tags not entirely necessary but would be nice.
	- Improve gear listing page based on reviews, ratings, and views to help find popular gear.
	- Review rating and reputation system like reddit. Up/downvotes plus inline display of user's karma.

4. **Extend to other gear types if possible.**
	- Video/Home Theater
	- Etc.
	- Rename to "StuffProfiles"
	- "Promoting Materialism and Vanity since 2012."
